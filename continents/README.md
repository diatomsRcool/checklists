## Continents

This was some quick and dirty code to compile taxon lists for continents using the country lists. They are not done particularly well and should be rerun using continent polygons.

## File Descriptions
continents.tsv - This is a table listing the countries and what continent they are in. The list is from Wikipedia and was modified to work for this application.
